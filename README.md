# Passive Investing Financial Analysis & Predictive Modelling

### Technical Description in Non-Technical Terms
This projectâ€™s goal is motivate individuals to passively invest in index funds or exchange traded funds (ETFs) for long-term / low-fee monetary growth that comes with a low-level of risk. The purpose of the finacial analyses (built with basic statistical techniques implemented with Python 3 - programming language) & the prediction models (complex machine learning algorithms that use Python 3 as well) provided as 'Notebooks' on this repository (web page) is to mathematically & statistically prove that the index funds (investment vehicles) have the tendency to increase in value or price with respect to time. In simple terms, the analyses and machine learning models support the hypothesis that passive investing (responsibly and strategically) will benefit individual's financial well being. In addition, these models were 'fed' with historical stock / ETF / Index Fund price data extracted or downloaded from the official Yahoo Finance website. Note that there are hundreds of funds currently available in the U.S. Stock Market - however, this project only includes the top 4 index funds or ETFs by asset size (Assets Under Management - AUM) from Morningstar categories (Large Blend, Large Value & Large Growth).
